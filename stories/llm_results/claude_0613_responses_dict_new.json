    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist is offered an incentive related to something they enjoy dreaming about (food for William, a Hawaii vacation for Karen) if they complete a difficult task (cleaning his room for William, graduating for Karen), but they fail to complete the task in time and do not receive the incentive. Story A lacks the key element of the protagonist dreaming about the offered incentive.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. Both stories involve someone who is distracted by daydreams and unable to accomplish a goal in the allotted time, resulting in not receiving an incentive reward. Story A does not emphasize the daydreaming aspect as much. Story B draws a clearer parallel."

  "Task 2": {
    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the manager/leader initially dismissed a safety recommendation, but then suffered a personal injury that caused them to quickly implement the safety measure. Story A lacks this sequence of the safety measure being proposed and initially dismissed before the injury occurred.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. Both involve a key person in a company getting injured by a new, sharper product made by their company. This personal experience then compelled them to swiftly implement the proposed safety mechanism. Story A is still analogous, but not as strong."

  "Task 3": {
    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the main character brags about never having an issue (being late or going hungry) because of a redundant system (two chauffeurs or two wives). However, due to a misunderstanding, the redundant safeguard fails and the main character still faces the issue (being late or going hungry). Story A does not fully capture this parallel situation of the safeguard failing to serve its purpose.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the main character brags about never having an issue (being late or going hungry) because of a redundant system (two chauffeurs or two wives). However, an unexpected event occurs revealing a flaw in this reasoning, so the character implements a second redundant element (hires another chauffeur or takes another wife) to try to avoid the issue happening again. Story A does not fully capture this pattern of events and solution."

  "Task 4": {
    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist offers something valuable to the antagonist in exchange for peace, but the antagonist ultimately uses what was given to attack the protagonist anyway. Story A does not include this element of the antagonist attacking after making a deal.",

    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist is warned about the risks of an action but ignores the warning, leading to negative consequences. Story A does not mention any warning given to the protagonist prior to taking the risky action. Story B parallels Story 1 more closely in this key aspect of the plot.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist makes a risky decision based on a lack of full understanding of the situation (Peter not realizing the danger of prolonged sun exposure, Quiggly not realizing the financial risk of space manufacturing). This leads to negative consequences, causing them to revert to their original state. Story A does not capture the lack of understanding leading to overreach."
  },
  "Task 6": {
    "order_1": " Story A is a better analogy to Story 1. Both involve a character who wants to obtain something to test a prediction about it, but is unable to reach/afford it. Story B involves the character changing her mind about wanting the item after realizing she can't have it.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. Both involve curiosity about something unavailable, disappointment over an inability to access the item, and speculation over whether initial predictions about the item were correct. Story A involves less curiosity and more rationalization about the item's lack of value after the initial disappointment."
  },
  "Task 7": {
    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the main character expects a favor in return for a gift, but the gift recipient is disappointed in the main character's behavior and refuses to reciprocate. Story A lacks the element of the gift recipient being disappointed in the main character's behavior.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the main character provides a service/gift to someone in hopes of getting something in return, but the recipient is disappointed and refuses to reciprocate. Story A lacks the detail that Sam gave his mother a gift from Tibet in order to get money from her. In 50 words or less, Story B more closely parallels the details and sequence of events from Story 1."

  "Task 8": {
    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist drops and loses his own valued item, then tries unsuccessfully to take a similar item from another, ending up worse off. Story A does not include the parallel element of Charlie originally having and losing his own watch.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist loses an item they possessed through their own actions.

In both stories, one partner makes a mistake (Ivan loses money, Christine dents John's car) which leads the other partner to restrict their access (Boris restricts Ivan's money management, John bans Christine from driving his car).

In both stories, one partner makes a mistake that causes a loss (Ivan losing cash, Christine denting the car), leading the other partner to restrict their access (Boris restricting Ivan's money access, John banning Christine from driving his car).

In both stories, one small country/student (Moreland) tries to make a deal with a larger threatening country/student (Mayonia/Chad) to hand over another small country/student (Salam/Lincoln) in exchange for being left alone. But the larger country/student takes advantage and conquers/robs both smaller countries/students anyway. Story A does not include this attempt at a deal, so Story B matches the plot more closely.",

In both stories, one of the weaker parties (Moreland/Bolon) attacks the other weaker party (Lincoln/Salam) in an attempt to improve its own position with the stronger party (Chad/Mayonia). However, this backfires as the stronger party takes advantage of and robs/conquers both of the weaker parties. Story A differs in that Moreland tries to make a deal with Chad rather than attacking Lincoln."

In both stories, the protagonist refuses to follow the advice they were given, leading to an unfortunate outcome when they do the opposite of what they were told.

    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist listens to and acts on the advice of someone else, even though that advice is not in their own best interest, and as a result suffers negative consequences.

  "Task 13": {
    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. Both stories involve a character obsessed with their main interest (conquests for the king, astronomy for Cornelius) and neglecting domestic needs (bridges for the king, house maintenance for Cornelius).

In both stories, the protagonist startles an intruder by yelling, regrets doing so as it draws the intruder's attention, tries to appease the intruder by giving something up, takes the opportunity to escape while the intruder is distracted, and later discovers more things missing. Story A lacks the progression of events and cause-and-effect relationships that Story 1 and Story B share.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. Both involve a character trying to scare away an intruder, realizing that was a mistake, throwing something to the intruder as a distraction, escaping with most but not all of their possessions, and later finding more items missing.

  "Task 15": {
    "order_1": " Story A is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist is attacked by those they were caring for, after which a separate misfortune befalls the unattended assets. Story B has the misfortune precede the attack, so it does not parallel Story 1 as closely.",
