    "order_1": "Story A is a better analogy to Story 1.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Incentive and Failure:** In both Story 1 and Story A, the incentive (gingerbread and Hawaii trip, respectively) is offered *after* the individual has already significantly failed to meet the required condition (clean room and good grades).  The incentive is presented as a way to motivate them to improve *at that late stage*, when success is unlikely given the already existing deficit.  Both William and Karen are presented as having a pre-existing problem that makes the attainment of the goal unrealistic within the given timeframe.\n\n* **Lack of Time as the Key Factor:**  In both Story 1 and Story A, the central reason for failure is the lack of sufficient time to achieve the goal, even with the incentive provided. This is a direct parallel.\n\nStory B, on the other hand, differs significantly. While it shares the theme of a promised reward and subsequent failure, the reason for failure is different.  Karen's failure in Story B stems not from a lack of time, but from her continued distraction by dreaming of Hawaii *after* the incentive was offered.  This introduces a different causal element\u2014the incentive itself contributing to the failure\u2014that is absent from Story 1.  William's daydreaming in Story 1 is a pre-existing condition, not a consequence of the offered reward.\n\nTherefore, the core structure of the problem and its resolution (or lack thereof) is better mirrored in the relationship between Story 1 and Story A.\n",
    "order_2": "Story A is a better analogy to Story 1.\n\nBoth Story A and Story B share the surface-level similarity of involving a person failing to achieve a goal (graduation/passing inspection) and missing out on a promised reward (Hawaii trip/gingerbread) due to insufficient time and continued focus on the reward rather than the task.  However, the crucial difference lies in the *reason* for failure:\n\n* **Story 1 and Story A:** The promised reward (gingerbread/Hawaii trip) acts as a *distraction* leading to failure.  William and Karen are so focused on the *future reward* that they neglect the present task.  They don't put in the necessary effort *because* they are thinking about the reward, not in spite of it.\n\n* **Story B:** Karen fails *despite* the promise of the trip.  Her failure is attributed to her pre-existing poor performance and distraction *by* her desire to go to Hawaii, not *because* of the promise.  The promise is a potential motivator that fails, not a cause of the failure.\n\nTherefore, the causal link between the promised reward and the failure is much stronger and more analogous in Story A and Story 1.  Both stories show a failure arising directly from the distraction caused by anticipation of the reward.  Story B depicts a failure that existed independently of the reward, with the reward only serving as a potential (failed) solution.\n"

This injury leads to the adoption of a safety measure (safety razor/warning label) that was previously suggested but not prioritized.  The negative experience directly drives the change.\n\n* **Story B's Difference:** Story B differs because the safety measure (warning label) is proposed *before* the injury. Ms. Boyce's negligence, not the lack of the label itself, leads to the injury.  The analogy falters here because the crucial element in Story 1 is that the near-fatal accident *caused* the adoption of the safety feature, something missing in Story B.  The label's absence isn't the direct cause of the injury in Story B.\n\nTherefore, Story A mirrors the causal relationship and decision-making process of Story 1 much more closely than Story B.\n",

The injury is the catalyst for change.\n\n* **Story A's Differences:** Story A deviates by highlighting Ms. Boyce's initial *resistance* to the safety measure (warning label). While she eventually adopts it after her injury, the narrative emphasizes her initial disregard, making it less analogous to Story 1, where Mr. Newton's response, while delayed, wasn't characterized by initial resistance.  In Story 1, the safety feature was recommended, and after the accident, the manager accepted it as necessary.  Story B mirrors that more closely.\n\nTherefore, Story B's straightforward parallel to the causal relationship in Story 1 makes it the superior analogy.\n"

His solution is to marry a *second* wife (to presumably ensure a constant food supply).\n\n* **Unintended Consequences:** Both stories highlight the unintended negative consequences of the \"solution.\" Joseph incurs high expenses with the second chauffeur. Alexander incurs the social and possibly legal complications of bigamy.\n\nStory B, while involving multiple wives and food, is a different kind of problem. It's not about the *unreliability* of a single wife but rather a miscommunication and coordination failure between two wives, resulting in hunger.

The initial problem wasn't solved by the added resource; the assumed redundancy actually caused a worse outcome.\n\n* **Story A:** Alexander's solution to hunger (two wives) created a new problem (neither wife prepared food for him, assuming the other would). Again, the added resource didn't solve the initial problem, instead leading to a worse outcome.\n\nStory B differs significantly. While it also involves a man addressing a problem (lack of food) by adding a resource (a second wife), the underlying issue and the resolution are fundamentally different.  In Story B, the lack of food was due to the wife's assumption of her husband's absence, not a faulty assumption about the redundancy of resources.  The addition of a second wife is a direct solution to potential future food shortages, not a consequence of misjudged resource redundancy as seen in Story 1 and Story A.  It's a different kind of problem-solving altogether.\n\nTherefore, the analogous structure of assumed redundancy and unexpected negative consequences makes Story A a much stronger parallel to Story 1.\n"

Moreland's action directly contributes to Lincoln's predicament.\n\n* **Opportunistic Aggression:** In both Story 1 and Story A, the initial aggressor (Bolon and Moreland respectively) makes a seemingly strategic move (conquest/attack) that backfires spectacularly because it makes them weaker and more vulnerable to a greater threat.\n\n* **The \"Deal\" as a Catalyst:** Both stories feature a seemingly beneficial deal that ultimately proves disastrous.  Bolon's treaty with Mayonia, and Moreland's deal with Chad, both fail to achieve their intended purpose and instead hasten the downfall of the initial actors.\n\nStory B, on the other hand, differs significantly:\n\n* **Moreland's proactive betrayal:** In Story B, Moreland actively collaborates with Chad *before* Chad even arrives.  This is unlike Bolon, which only tries to make a deal *after* its conquest of Salam.  Moreland's action in Story B is more of a direct betrayal than a strategic maneuver that backfires.\n\n* **Lack of Parallel Vulnerability:** While both Moreland and Bolon end up vulnerable, the reason differs. Bolon's vulnerability stems from its prior action of conquering Salam, whereas Moreland's vulnerability in Story B is a direct consequence of his active choice to assist Chad.\n\nTherefore, the chain of events and the causal relationships in Story A much more closely mirror those in Story 1.

His efforts to stop Lincoln from getting help backfire, leaving both of them at the mercy of Chad.

A sacrifice is made to escape immediate danger (lamb/bag of coins).\n    4.  Temporary escape and a false sense of security.\n    5.  A later discovery of further loss (missing lamb/missing bag of coins).  The cause of this later loss is ambiguous in both stories.\n\n* **Difference from Story B:** Story B streamlines the narrative.  The beggar's appearance immediately scares Zebediah, eliminating the parallel to Frederick's initial mistake of shouting. Zebediah's action of throwing the money is a direct response to fear, not a consequence of a prior mistake. The later loss of a coin bag, while present in both A and B, feels less connected to the preceding events in Story B.  The implication is that perhaps the beggar somehow stole it after he had already left.\n\nIn essence, Story A mirrors the structure and underlying cause-and-effect relationship of Story 1 more closely.  Both stories highlight a flawed initial response leading to a subsequent loss, even after a seemingly successful escape. Story B lacks this crucial element of a flawed initial reaction causing escalating problems.\n"

    "order_1": "Story A is a better analogy to Story 1.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Similar Causality (or lack thereof):** In Story 1, the chickens attack Mark for an unknown reason, leading to a secondary consequence (the theft).  In Story A, the girls pester Linda for seemingly no significant reason related to the impending disaster, leading to the secondary consequence (loss of sleeping bags).  The initial conflict is unrelated to the main event's cause.\n\n* **Temporal Sequence:**  Both Story 1 and Story A follow a similar sequence:  Initial conflict, then a separate event causing damage, followed by the protagonist leaving the scene.\n\nStory B differs significantly:\n\n* **Causality:** The girls' attack in Story B is directly caused by the loss of the sleeping bags \u2013 a direct consequence of the tidal wave.  This is unlike Story 1, where the chicken's attack is unrelated to the egg theft.  The cause-and-effect relationship is different.\n\n* **Temporal Sequence:** The main event (tidal wave) occurs *before* the conflict in Story B, whereas in Story 1 and A, the initial conflict precedes the damaging event.\n\nTherefore, Story A mirrors the structure and implied lack of direct causation between the initial conflict and the main event more closely than Story B does.  The \"unrelated attack followed by a secondary consequence\" element is the key similarity.\n",
    "order_2": "Story A is a better analogy to Story 1.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Causality:** In Story 1, the chickens' attack is a *distraction* leading to the theft.  Mark's misfortune (being attacked) indirectly causes the theft of his eggs.  Similarly, in Story A, the girl scouts' attack is a distraction, indirectly leading to the loss of the sleeping bags.  Linda's misfortune (being attacked) causes her to be unable to prevent the loss.\n\n* **Sequence of Events:** Both Story 1 and Story A follow this pattern:  (1) Main character faces a problem unrelated to the main event, (2) A negative secondary event happens while the main character is distracted dealing with the first problem.  (3) The main character suffers a loss due to the indirect effect of the first problem.\n\nStory B reverses the causality. The tidal wave (the main negative event) occurs *after* the pestering. The pestering is not a causative factor leading to the loss of the sleeping bags.  It's a separate event that precedes the disaster. This doesn't mirror the structure of Story 1.  In Story 1, the chickens' attack is the *cause* of the vulnerability that allows the theft; in Story B, the pestering is not the cause of the tidal wave and the resulting loss of sleeping bags.\n\nTherefore, Story A more closely parallels the cause-and-effect relationship and the sequence of events in Story 1, making it a better analogy.\n"

    "order_1": "Story A is a better analogy to Story 1.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Similar Resolution:** In both Story 1 and Story A, a third party intervenes and solves the conflict by fairly dividing the contested resource.  This leads to a positive outcome where the original disputants resolve their conflict and even develop a positive relationship (Story 1) or at least gain some benefit (Story A).\n\n* **Story B's Key Difference:** Story B introduces a crucial difference.  The third party doesn't resolve the conflict fairly; instead, she takes the resource for herself. This changes the narrative significantly and doesn't reflect the resolution of Story 1, where the intervention leads to a positive outcome for the original disputants.  The analogy breaks down because the core element of a fair resolution by a third party is missing.\n\nTherefore, Story A mirrors the structure and outcome of Story 1 much more closely than Story B.\n",
    "order_2": "Story B is a better analogy to Story 1.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Story 1:**  The conflict is resolved by a third party (Sheriff Jones) who divides the resource fairly.  The protagonists then learn from this and cooperate.\n\n* **Story A:** The conflict is *not* resolved in a way analogous to Story 1. The third party (Lee) takes the resource entirely, leaving the protagonists with nothing.  There's no fair division and no learning opportunity leading to cooperation.\n\n* **Story B:**  The third party (Lee) acts as a catalyst for the same outcome as the Sheriff in Story 1.  Though Lee initially takes the resource, she then divides it fairly. This mirrors the lesson learned by Smith and Johnson.  The intervention leads to a fair division and ultimately cooperation, just like in the original story.\n\nTherefore, Story B more closely mirrors the structure and lesson of Story 1.  The resolution, although arriving indirectly, is fundamentally the same: a fair division leads to cooperation.  Story A's resolution is entirely different and lacks the key element of cooperation resulting from a fair resolution.\n"

The captain's vacation announcement comes *after* McGhee's act of sabotage.  This weakens the analogy because the captain's action isn't the direct cause of McGhee's anger in Story A.  The captain's decision in Story A is a consequence, not a cause, of McGhee's actions.
