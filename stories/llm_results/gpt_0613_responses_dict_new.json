    "order_1": "The best answer is Story B. Just like in Story 1 with William daydreaming about the gingerbread instead of cleaning his room, Karen in Story B is daydreaming about Hawaii and preparing for her trip instead of focusing on passing her classes. Both characters failed to meet their objectives as a result of their daydreaming and anticipation.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story A. In both Story 1 and Story A, William and Karen are promised a reward for completing a task (cleaning the room and improving grades, respectively), but fail to meet the requirements because they spend too much time daydreaming about the reward (gingerbread and Hawaii trip, respectively). Even though they are motivated by the promise, neither of them takes the necessary steps to earn the reward. In contrast, Story B presents Karen as already dreaming of Hawaii before the reward is mentioned."

  "Task 2": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story B. In both Story 1 and Story B, the person in charge initially dismisses a proposed safety feature until they themselves are harmed by the product, at which point they quickly implement the safety measure. In contrast, in Story A, the safety measure is implemented immediately after the potential harm is discovered, without the person in charge needing to experience the harm themselves.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. It's a better analogy to Story 1 as both involve the person in charge experiencing an injury from a new invention and then agreeing to add a safety feature recommended by another party after the incident. Story A differs in the sequence of events, where the person in charge dismisses the safety warning until after the injury occurs."
  },
  "Task 3": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story B. \n\nThis is because both Story 1 and Story B revolve around the idea of individuals putting their trust in multiple service providers (the chauffeurs or the wives), assuming they will get their needs (being driven, being fed) met. Both stories involve a miscommunication or misunderstanding that results in the main character not receiving the expected service. Story A is less analogous as the second wife is presented as a solution to the problem rather than part of the cause.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story A. In both stories, the subject has two of something for reassurance (Joseph has two chauffeurs and Alexander has two wives) and both circumstances lead to unintentional neglect (the chauffeur sleeping and the first wife not cooking enough food) assuming the other will compensate. Story B differs because Alexander gets a second wife out of reaction to a situation, not as a boasting point or for reassurance as in Story 1."
  },
  "Task 4": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. In both Story 1 and Story A, the character/country under potential harm offers something of value to the potential threat, which then leads to the threat deciding not to harm or attack. In Story B, despite the initial offering, the threat still harms the character/country. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to Story 1.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. Similar to Story 1 where Karla, the hawk, gives the hunter something he wants (her feathers) to protect herself, in Story B, Zerdia offers something valuable (the smart computers) to Gagrach to prevent further attacks. In both cases, they are achieving peace by offering something valuable. Story A, on the other hand, features betrayal and a negative outcome for the party that gave something away, which is not analogous to Story 1."
  },
  "Task 5": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. Both Story 1 and Story A contain characters that took risks based on misinformed decisions (Peter getting a tan and Quiggly investing in a space factory), without understanding the full implications. As a result, they both suffer negative consequences (Peter getting burns and Quiggly's stocks plunging) and decide to return to their previous states (Peter going back to Iceland and Quiggly returning to manufacturing conventional electrical components).",
    "order_2": "The best answer would be Story B. Like Peter who moved to Florida and tried to tan himself to fit in without understanding the risks, Quiggly Co. tried to get into the integrated circuit market and build a space factory without understanding the financial risks, which led to financial loss much like Peter's experience with sunburn. In both stories, the characters made a risky decision without understanding the full implications, suffered negative consequences as a result, and ultimately returned to their original state - Peter to Iceland and Quiggly Co. to producing conventional electric components. While Story A also shares some similarities, the fact that Quiggly Co. didn't face the negative consequences of a risky decision makes it a slightly less fitting analogy."
  },
  "Task 6": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. Both Story 1 and Story A involve characters who have doubts about the value of an item (pears and records respectively) but still want to check if their predictions are correct, but can't because of a barrier; in Julius's case it's because the pears are too high and in Cindy's because the records are too expensive. In Story B, Cindy seems to convince herself that it's better she didn't get the records assuming they would be boring which is not in line with story 1 where Julius never reassures himself about the pears being rotten.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. It is a better analogy to Story 1 because, like Julius who was curious about the rotten pears but couldn't reach them, Cindy was curious about the records but couldn't afford them. In Story A, Cindy dismissed the records completely unlike Julius who never lost interest in the pears."
  },
  "Task 7": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. In both Story 1 and Story A, the main characters (Percy and Sam) present a form of entertainment or a gift (song or Tibetan gift), expecting reciprocity (seeds or loan). However, their efforts are not appreciated as they anticipated, leading to a negative response from the recipients (the squirrel and Sam's mother). In Story B, even though Sam gives a gift hoping for a loan, the element of him initially doing something for his mother (like Percy's song) is not present, making Story A a better analogy to Story 1.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. Both Story A and Story B share many similarities with Story 1 in terms of narrative structure, but Story B is a closer analogy to Story 1. In both Story B and Story 1, the main character makes a gesture (Percy singing a song, Sam presenting a gift) with the expectation of receiving something specific in return (seeds from the squirrel, money from Sam's mother). When this gesture is not met with the expected return, the main character's plan is thwarted. This key element is not as clear in Story A, making Story B a better analogy of Story 1."
  },
  "Task 8": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. In both Story 1 and Story A, the main character loses their valued possession inadvertently. Then, they attempt to take a similar possession from another character, which leads to further trouble or loss. In contrast, Story B involves a significant difference wherein the character is misled by his reflection and drops his watch while attempting to grab an identical one, which is not a scenario represented in Story 1. So, Story A is more analogous to Story 1.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story A. This is because in both stories, the character loses their own possession while trying to take another's, which turns out to be an illusion/misunderstanding (the dog's steak is his reflection and the watch is his own reflection). In Story B, Charlie does not lose his watch because of an attempt to steal another's, rather he just drops it, making it less similar to Story 1."
  },
  "Task 9": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. Both Story 1 and Story A involve two people who have respect for each other and plan to collaborate on something (a store, a marriage). However, due to careless actions by one party (Ivan throwing out cash, Christine denting the car), the other party restricts their involvement in a specific aspect of the collaboration (handling money, driving the car). In contrast, Story B contains an element of intentional harm (Christine damaging the car out of spite) that isn't present in Story 1.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. Similar to Story 1, it involves a partnership with one party getting into a mishap (Ivan losing cash and Christine denting John's car), which leads the other party to prohibit them from a particular task (Boris prohibiting Ivan from handling money and John banning Christine from driving his car). Story A does not fit as well because Christine's reaction (denting John's car out of spite) does not align with Ivan's response (selling his stereo set to replace the lost cash)."
  },
  "Task 10": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. \n\nIn both Story 1 and Story A, the smaller party (Bolon/Moreland) tries to make the best of a dangerous situation by overtaking the weakest party (Salam/Lincoln), and even proposes to the larger threatening party (Mayonia/Chad) to take control of their prey, in order to secure their own safety. However, this proposition backfires, resulting in the larger party taking advantage of both the smaller parties. The sequence of events as well as the relations between the parties align more closely between Story 1 and Story A than Story B. \n\nIn Story B, the proposal to Chad pops up only after Lincoln hears Moreland's plan - which is a deviation from Story 1 in which Salam had no knowledge of Bolon's proposition to Mayonia before it occurred. Furthermore, Story B involves exhaustion as a factor for Moreland's inability to stop Chad, while in Story 1 and A, the smaller party is simply too busy maintaining control over the weakest party to prevent the stronger party's actions.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. \n\nIn Story 1, Bolon tries to take advantage of the situation by taking over Salam, just as Moreland tries to take advantage of the situation by attacking Lincoln in Story B. And just as Mayonia ends up taking over both Bolon and Salam, Chad robs both Moreland and Lincoln. \n\nIn Story A, Moreland offers to help Chad rob Lincoln rather than taking action to dominate Lincoln himself, which makes it less analogous to Story 1."
  },
  "Task 11": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. It is a better analogy to Story 1 because, like in Story 1, a beloved object (a canary) becomes unwell or loses its function, someone else steps in to care for it, it recovers under the new care, and regains its prior function (the ability to sing). On the other hand, in Story B, the bird does not recover once it's moved, making it fundamentally different from Story 1, where the apricot tree recovers and flourishes after being moved.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. This story is a better analogy to Story 1 as in both stories, the valued object (the apricot tree in Story 1, the canary in Story B) becomes ill or withered, someone appreciates its value, buys it, provides care, and it resumes producing what it was valued for - the apricot tree bearing fruit and the canary singing. In Story A, the canary becomes fatally ill after being moved, which does not reflect the happy outcome of Story 1."
  },
  "Task 12": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. Both Story 1 and Story A involve a character who escapes or hides, but then remembers advice given by someone else, follows it and as a result, gets caught by an authority figure (cops and Jenny's mother, respectively). In contrast, Story B has Jenny disregarding the advice given to her by her neighbor, making it less analogous.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. It is a better analogy to Story 1 because, like Morris, Jenny does something she was told to do (in this case, playing with her dog in her own yard), which leads to her being discovered. This is similar to Morris playing the harmonica leading to his capture. In Story A, Jenny doesn't listen to the advice given, which differentiates it from Story 1."
  },
  "Task 13": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. It presents a closer analogy to Story 1. In both Story 1 and Story A, the main character is transforming a part of the kingdom or his home, respectively, with a specific purpose (King Otto strengthening the bridges for his armies and Cornelius turning his home into an observatory). In each case, a close associate (the chamberlain or wife) points out that they are focusing too much on the transformation project at the cost of their primary responsibility (military campaigns or astronomy). This causes the main character to switch their focus back, leading to a negative outcome, which ultimately reveals the need for balanced attention between their principal duty and current project. This narrative structure and resulting lesson are more similar between Story 1 and Story A than Story B, where the neglect is of a necessary maintenance task rather than an ambitious project.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story A. Both Story A and Story B share similarities with Story 1, as all involve a main character neglecting important tasks due to an obsession. But, Story A is a closer analogy because it represents the change of priorities over time, as does Story 1. In both cases, the protagonist initially neglects an important responsibility (house maintenance or bridge construction) in favor of a personal obsession (astronomy or warfare). This decision eventually leads to an accident (falling through a floor or a bridge), which prompts a change in priorities. While Story B also involves a shift in focus, it doesn't replicate the initial neglect and resultant change of priorities as closely as Story A does."
  },
  "Task 14": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. This is because, like in Story 1, the character in Story A unintentionally attracts the attention of the potential threat (the beggar in this case) through their initial reaction, which leads them to give part of what they are guarding (money for Zebediah, sheep for Frederick) to appease the threat and ensure their safety. The situation later aggravates as they lose some more of what they were trying to protect initially. Story B doesn't precisely mirror this sequence of events.",
    "order_2": "The best analogy to Story 1 is Story B. In both Story 1 and Story B, the main characters Frederick and Zebediah initially provoke the potential threat - the lion and the beggar, respectively - by yelling or speaking loudly. They then realize that this was not the best course of action. To distract the threat, they give up something valuable (a lamb, a bag of coins) and use the opportunity to get to safety. Finally, they discover later that they have lost an additional valuable item (another lamb, another bag of coins) without understanding exactly how. Story A doesn\u2019t have the element of the main character starting the interaction or confrontation, as Zebediah only starts yelling after he notices his bag of coins missing."

  "Task 15": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. In both Story 1 and Story A, the protagonist is pestered by the group they are responsible for (chickens for Mark; girl scouts for Linda) and leave the scene, which then leads to a crisis or loss happening (theft of the eggs; tidal wave washing away the sleeping bags). Story B, however, starts with the crisis, which leads to the group pestering the protagonist. Hence, the sequence of events is different.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story A. This story is a better analogy to Story 1 because in both cases, the person in charge (Mark the chicken farmer in Story 1 and Linda the camp director in Story A) stands alone while something valuable (the eggs in Story 1 and the sleeping bags in Story A) is washed away or stolen. When the ones they're responsible for (the chickens in Story 1 and the girl scouts in Story A) came back, unable to find what they were looking for (eggs/sleeping bags), they attacked the person in charge, driving them away. This chain of events, and the relationships between the characters and items, make Story A a closer match than Story B to Story 1."
  },
  "Task 16": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. The key parallel in these stories is the dispute over a common resource and its eventual equal division by a third party. In Story 1, Smith and Johnson argue over the land and Sheriff Jones divides it for them, while in Story A, Betty and Norma argue over the money and Lee divides it for them. This resolution is not present in Story B, as Lee keeps the money for herself. Therefore, Story A is more analogous to Story 1.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. It is a better analogy to Story 1 because, similar to Story 1 where Sheriff Jones divided the land evenly between Smith and Johnson, in Story B, Lee divided the twenty dollar bill evenly between Betty and Norma. In both cases, the third person played a peacemaker's role, and the initial conflict parties realized they should have divided the disputed object by themselves from the beginning. In contrast, in Story A, Lee took the money for herself, which was not a fair resolution like in Story 1."

  "Task 17": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. \n\nIn both Story 1 and Story A, a person in authority (principal/captain) gives themselves a privilege (salary increase/vacation) while denying a similar privilege to someone under their authority (teacher/sailor). The person under the authority then takes a destructive form of retaliation (setting fire to the principal\u2019s office/blowing up the captain's cabin). In contrast, Story B doesn\u2019t have the same sequence or causal relationship of events as in Story 1.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. Although both stories A and B parallel Story 1 in terms of a character wanting something they can't have, then taking revenge, Story B is more analogous as it follows the order of events more closely to Story 1. In each of these stories, the authority figure first announces their decision, then the other character becomes upset and takes a revenge action against them. In contrast, Story A starts with the revenge action first."
  },
  "Task 18": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story B. Similar to Story 1, in Story B the one who initiates the physical contact (the policeman, like the falcon) captures the other character (Gene, like the cobra Pierre). Only afterward does the captured character (Gene or Pierre) retaliate, causing their eventual shared demise. This sequence of events is more closely mirrored in Story B than in Story A.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story A. This is because, similar to Story 1, the character (policeman) that initiates the action (grabbing Gene) ends up in a dire situation due to the reaction of the other character (Gene hitting the policeman). This similar sequence is also seen in Story 1 when the falcon grabs the cobra (Pierre) and ends up getting wounded. Therefore, Story A follows a more similar progression and is a better analogy to Story 1."
