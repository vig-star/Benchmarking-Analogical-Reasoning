  "Task 1": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. \n\nIn both Story 1 and Story A, the individuals (William and Karen) spent too much time daydreaming rather than focusing on accomplishing the task at hand (cleaning room for inspection or graduating high school). The incentive to do the tasks was given late and they were too far behind to actually complete the tasks, leading them to miss the reward (gingerbread or trip to Hawaii). Consequently, they faced disappointment. While story B also shares these common themes, it's the aspect of daydreaming in Story A that makes it a more appropriate match to Story 1.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story A. It is a better analogy to Story 1 because in both stories, the characters (William and Karen) are given the incentive to get something they desire only if they fulfil certain conditions (cleaning the room and passing the classes, respectively). Just like William, Karen is also overjoyed by the possibility but spends most of her time daydreaming, causing her not to fulfil the condition and therefore not receiving the desired thing (the gingerbread and the trip to Hawaii, respectively). In both stories, the characters do not have enough time to fulfill those conditions due to their late start or avoidance of the task. Story B is slightly different in that Karen is already behind in her studies before the incentive was proposed."
  },
  "Task 2": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. This is because in both Story 1 and Story A, the safety measure (the safety feature in Story 1 and the warning labels in Story A) was initially recommended due to a new development (the sharper razor and the more intense heat lamp). Only after the person in charge (Mr. Newton and Ms. Boyce) experienced an accident themselves, did they consider the safety measure absolutely necessary. In Story B, however, Ms. Boyce initially disregards the recommended warning labels and only after her accident decides to implement them.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. This story is a better analogy to Story 1 because in both scenarios, the person in charge (Mr. Newton and Ms. Boyce) was injured using the new product, and only then realized the necessity for a safety feature or warning. In Story A, Ms. Boyce considers the labels unnecessary and only implements them after the accident - this difference makes Story B a closer analogy to Story 1."

  "Task 3": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. In both Story 1 and Story A, a man (Joseph and Alexander respectively) relies too much on one person (a chauffeur and a wife respectively) to provide a crucial service (driving and cooking respectively), but gets let down when that person wrongly assumes they would not be needed that day. To prevent this issue from happening again, both men resort to an expensive solution: Joseph hires a second chauffeur who demands a high salary and fancy uniform, whereas Alexander gets a second wife. \n\nStory B, in contrast, focuses on a man with two wives who both fail him on the same day, which is a different scenario and solution than Joseph faced in Story 1.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. In both Story 1 and Story B, a solution is provided for the problem: Joseph hires a second chauffeur and Alexander marries a second wife. However, in Story A, even though the situation has some similarities, the solution is missing. Thus, Story B is a better analogy to Story 1."
  },
  "Task 4": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. It's a better analogy to Story 1 because in both Story 1 and Story A, a potential threat (the hunter in Story 1 and Gagrach in Story A) initially fails to achieve their goal and the 'prey' (Karla the hawk in Story 1 and Zerdia in Story A) voluntarily offers what the threat wants, which leads to a peaceful resolution. In contrast, Story B entails a betrayal, which does not happen in Story 1.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. This is because, like in Story 1, the party being attacked (Karla in Story 1, Zerdia in Story B) realizes what the attacker (the hunter in Story 1, Gagrach in Story B) wants and offers it to them. This results in the attacker pledging not to attack again. Story A is not similar because in that scenario, the attacker takes advantage of the resource offered and still attacks."
  },
  "Task 5": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. It is more analogous to Story 1 because in both these stories, Peter and Quiggly Company put themselves at risk trying to fit in or compete without fully understanding the risks and consequences involved, which end up hurting them in the end. In Story B, Quiggly Company was aware of the risks and decided not to venture, making it less similar to Story 1.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. Story 1 and Story B both involve someone taking a risk without fully understanding the consequences, which leads them to revert to their old situation. Whereas in Story A, Quiggly Company followed the market analysts' warning and decide not to risk entering the space manufacturing arena."

  "Task 6": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. In both Story 1 and Story A, the characters (Julius and Cindy) are interested in objects (pears and records) that they suspect are not in good condition (rotten and really bad respectively). However, physical constraints (pears being too high and records being too expensive) prevent them from verifying their hunch. Both characters consequently feel disappointment, similar to the mule in Story 1. Story B differs in that Cindy reassesses her desire for the records, rather than being stopped by a physical constraint and being disappointed as a result.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. Similar to Story 1, in Story B, Cindy was curious about something (the records), just as Julius was curious about the pears. But in both scenarios, the characters could not get what they were curious about due to some obstacle (price for Cindy, and height for Julius), leading them to become disappointed. While Story A also involves disappointment due to an obstacle, Cindy was not interested in confirming a hunch she had about the records, which makes it less analogous to Story 1 where Julius wanted to confirm his prediction."

  "Task 7": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. In both Story 1 and Story A, the characters (Percy and Sam) offer a gift/song in hopes of receiving something in return, but are rebuked by the other character due to disappointment in the quality of the gift/song. Story B differs slightly, as Sam's mother is upset with him for his lifestyle choices, rather than being disappointed with the gift he gives her.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story A. It's a better analogy to Story 1 because in both stories, the main characters (Percy and Sam) are trading a service or gift (song or Tibetan gift) with an expectation of receiving something in return (sunflower seeds or a loan). However, both the squirrel and Sam's mother are displeased and refuse to give what was expected (wheat or money). While Story B also exhibits similar characteristics, the emphasis on the object (the Tibetan gift) being deemed worthless makes it less analogous to Story 1, where Percy's singing skill is criticized rather than the value of the song itself."
  },
  "Task 8": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. This is because, similar to Story 1, Charlie has lost something of value due to his own behavior and then attempts to take another's similar item, resulting in further negative consequences. In contrast, Story B involves Charlie attempting to take the item due to greed and a mistaken reflection, not because he has lost his own item as in Story 1. Therefore, Story A is a better analogy.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story A. The events in Story A are more closely related to Story 1 than Story B is, in terms of the sequence of events and the character's motivations. In both Story 1 and Story A, the main characters (Leonard the dog and Charlie) lose their valuable items (a steak and a watch respectively) due to their own misjudgment \u2014 the dog loses his steak into the lake; Charlie loses his watch because he thought his reflection was another person with a watch. Similarly, after losing their items, both characters attempt to get a similar item from another character, leading to further loss or negative outcome. In Story B, Charlie loses his watch through an accidental drop rather than through a misjudgment or misunderstanding."

  "Task 9": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. This is because, like in Story 1, a mistake (Christine denting the car/Ivan losing the cash) leads to a decision being made about their responsibility (Christine not driving the car/Ivan not handling the money). Story B involves deliberate harm (Christine denting the car on purpose), which is not analogous to Story 1.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. This story is more analogous to Story 1 because in both circumstances, the characters (Ivan and Christine) make mistakes accidentally (Ivan throwing out cash, Christine denting the car), which leads to the other characters (Boris and John) imposing restrictions (Ivan being refrained from handling monetary matters, Christine being forbidden to drive the car). In Story A, Christine intentionally dents John's car, which doesn't parallel Ivan's unintentional loss of cash in Story 1."
  },
  "Task 10": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. This is because in both Story 1 and Story A, one entity (Bolon/Moreland) takes over another entity (Salam/Lincoln). This captured entity then tries to seek aid but fails because of the initial entity. Then that initial entity (Bolon/Moreland) tries to negotiate with a stronger entity (Mayonia/Chad), offering the captured entity as a gesture for their safety. However, the stronger entity goes on to overrun both of them. Story B differs significantly from Story 1 on the point where Moreland suggests an alliance with Chad to rob Lincoln rather than taking over Lincoln himself.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. Story B is a more accurate analogy to Story 1 because Moreland's actions of overpowering Lincoln and offering him to Chad parallels Bolon's action of taking over Salam and offering it to Mayonia. Additionally, in both cases, the bully (Chad or Mayonia) ends up overpowering both parties, just like Mayonia did to both Salam and Bolon in Story 1."
  },
  "Task 11": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. This is because in both Story 1 and Story A, the valued item (apricot tree and canary) initially falls into some sort of decline (withering, falling ill) but then recovers and performs beautifully again (bearing delicious apricots, singing beautiful songs) once someone else (the judge, veterinarian friend) takes over its care. This narrative arc is not present in Story B; in that story, the canary's condition worsens after it is moved, which is not analogous to what happens in Story 1.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. It provides a better analogy to Story 1 because just like the apricot tree in Story 1, the canary in Story B was highly valued, fell ill, and then was sold and moved to a new location where it regained its previous prized attribute (songs for the canary and fruit for the tree). Story A does not fit as well since the canary becomes fatally ill after being moved, which does not align with the positive outcome in Story 1."
  },
  "Task 12": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. This story is a better analogy to Story 1 because, similar to Morris going against the rules and then deciding to follow the advice he was given (which leads to his capture), Jenny also goes against the rules and decides to follow the advice given to her (which leads to her getting caught). Story B does not follow this pattern as Jenny does not follow the advice given to her and no consequence is directly related to the neighbor's advice.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. This story is a better analogy to Story 1 because it includes significant elements found in Story 1 such as: disobeying a rule, escaping from somewhere, doing something they were told to do daily and getting caught because of it, and regretting listening to the person who gave them that advice. Story A lacks some of these key elements, specifically escaping and getting caught as a result of doing something they were told to do daily."
  },
  "Task 13": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. This is because in both Story 1 and Story A, the main characters (King Otto and Cornelius respectively) are overly invested in their passion (war and astronomy) to the point of neglecting important duties (infrastructure and home maintenance). After a complaint from a close person (the chamberlain and Agatha), they both shift their focus entirely back to their original obsessions, only to be caught in an accident due to unfinished projects. This event leads to a realization of the need for a balance. In Story B, Cornelius doesn't shift his focus after Agatha's complaints but continues with his obsession until an accident happens, which is a deviation from the sequence of events in Story 1.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story A. In both Story 1 and Story A, the characters (King Otto and Cornelius, respectively) are so obsessed with one thing (military conquest and astronomy) that they neglect important elements in their immediate surroundings (bridges and home maintenance). Both King Otto and Cornelius are cautioned by others (the chamberlain and Agatha), but they do not heed the advice until an accident happens, leading them to balance their obsession and their immediate responsibilities. Meanwhile, Story B strays from this core similarity because in it, Agatha complains about Cornelius spending too much time renovating the home and not enough time on job (astronomy), which is the opposite of Story 1, where Otto neglects the domestic needs of his kingdom in favor of military campaigns."
  },
  "Task 14": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. Story A more closely follows the sequence and structure of Story 1, where a character is initially alone, encounters danger unexpectedly, makes noise that ironically makes things worse, and sacrifices a possession to distract the danger before securing their safety, followed by a surprising additional loss. Story B changes the order of events and has the character losing something before the danger appears.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. This story is a better analogy to Story 1 because it follows a similar sequence of events. In both stories, the main characters (Frederick and Zebediah) are going about their normal routine when they are suddenly confronted by a potentially dangerous being (a lion and a beggar). Their attempts to frighten the intruder only attracts more attention. To avoid harm, they make a sacrifice (a lamb and a bag of coins). While the intruder is preoccupied, they remove themselves from the situation. Later, they fall asleep and upon awakening discover an additional loss they hadn't initially noticed. Both characters regret their initial response to the intruder, and they make adjustments to prevent future recurrences. This sequence of events is more similar than the sequence in story A."
  },
  "Task 15": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. While both stories share some similarities with Story 1 such as the return of a group and a disaster happening when the primary character is away, Story A is more analogous as it follows the same sequence of events as Story 1. In Story A, like Story 1, the leader (Linda or Mark) is distracted when the group (girls scouts or chickens) returns and begins to attack or pester. The leader then leaves the area, a disaster occurs, resulting in a significant loss. In Story B, the disaster occurs before the group's return, which is a major difference in the sequence of events compared to Story 1.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story A. In both Story 1 and Story A, the protagonist is absent when a disaster occurs, and upon returning, they are attacked by the group they are in charge of, leading to an unexpected negative outcome (Mark being chased by chickens and the eggs being stolen; the girl scouts' sleeping bags being washed away). Story B differs in the sequence of events and lacks the consequential disaster due to the protagonists' absence."
  },
  "Task 16": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. This story is a better analogy to Story 1 as in both circumstances, a third party intervenes in a dispute over a shared find, dividing it up equally between the two original parties. In the end, both parties realize they should have divided it themselves. In contrast, Story B differs because the third party takes the shared find for herself. So, Story A is more similar to Story 1.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. This story is more analogous to Story 1 because in both stories a third party comes along when two individuals are arguing over a valuable item and the third party then divides the item between the two individuals. In Story A, the third party simply takes the item while the two individuals are arguing, which is not analogous to Story 1."
  },
  "Task 17": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. Just like in Story 1 where Mrs. Jackson became angry and took revenge when she didn't get a salary increase but the principal increased his salary, in Story A, McGhee became upset and sought revenge when he didn't get a land vacation but the captain announced his own vacation. In both stories, frustration lead to an act of vengeance. Hence, Story A bears a more direct analogy to Story 1 than Story B.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. This story is a better analogy to Story 1 as in both stories, the protagonists (Mrs. Jackson and McGhee) feel slighted by a decision made by a higher authority (the principal and the captain) that benefits the authority but not them. In response, they both decide to take revenge by causing destruction (setting fire and blowing up a cabin). Story A is less analogous because the protagonist's actions of blowing up the captain's cabin seem to be driven by impatience instead of revenge."

  "Task 18": {
    "order_1": "The best answer is Story A. In both Story 1 and Story A, the character who initiates the conflict (Pierre the cobra and young Gene) is the one who first acts out of fear and causes harm (Pierre biting the falcon and Gene hitting the policeman). Then, the other character in response to the assault escalates the situation, which eventually leads to both their deaths. In contrast, Story B deviates from this sequence as the policeman first grabs Gene before Gene retaliates.",
    "order_2": "The best answer is Story B. In both Story 1 and Story B, it is the provoked party (Pierre the cobra and Gene respectively) who first strikes out of fear, and then the other party (the falcon and the policeman) who, because of the initial aggression, decides to carry the first party away. The consequences, unfortunately, prove fatal for both involved. The order of the events in these two stories aligns, making Story B a better analogy than Story A."
