The reward is directly tied to a task the individual is struggling to complete due to their own behavior (daydreaming).\n\n* **Failure Due to Lack of Time/Effort:** In both stories, the failure isn't due to an insurmountable obstacle. Instead, the protagonists fail to achieve the goal because they run out of time or don't put in the necessary effort to overcome their initial lack of progress.  While William daydreamed and didn't clean his room, Karen daydreamed and didn't study enough.\n\nStory B differs significantly because Karen's failure is presented as a result of her continued apathy and daydreaming *despite* the incentive. In Story 1 and Story A, the initial motivation (the reward) *did* spur some level of effort, even if ultimately insufficient.  Story B suggests the Hawaii trip was more of a distraction, leading to continued failure, rather than a source of short-lived but unsuccessful motivation.  This is a key difference.\n",

The inability to achieve the goal isn't due to a lack of trying *after* the motivation, but rather because the pre-existing situation was too severe to overcome in the given time.\n\n* **Story A's Difference:** Story A introduces a crucial difference. Karen *does* actively engage in preparation for her trip (dreaming and planning). This implies that she *did* attempt to improve her situation after the incentive was offered, unlike William who continued to daydream.  This changes the core of the analogy.  William's failure is entirely a consequence of his prior inaction and the short timeframe. Karen's failure in Story A, while still resulting from poor prior performance, also incorporates some level of effort *after* the incentive was offered.\n\nTherefore, the inaction before the incentive and the subsequent inability to overcome the consequences of that inaction are far more closely mirrored in Story 1 and Story B.\n"

The recommendation for the safety feature comes *before* the injury in both.\n\n* **Story B's Difference:** In Story B, the recommendation for the warning label comes *after* Ms. Boyce's injury.

    "order_2": "Story B is a better analogy to Story 1.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Similar Causal Chain:** Both Story 1 and Story B share a similar structure of events:  an initial encounter with a threat (lion/beggar), a panicked reaction that worsens the situation (shouting), a desperate attempt to appease the threat (offering a lamb/coins), a temporary escape, and a *later* discovery of further loss (missing lamb/coins).  The later loss is a consequence of the initial interaction, not a direct result of the appeasement.\n\n* Story A reverses the order of events:**  Story A has the loss occurring *before* the encounter with the beggar.  The beggar's appearance is a reaction to Zebediah's yelling, not the cause of his additional loss.  The missing bag of coins is not directly linked to the encounter with the beggar in the same way the missing lamb is linked to the lion encounter in Story 1.\n\n\nIn essence, Story B mirrors the narrative structure and causal relationships of Story 1 much more closely than Story A does.  The unexpected second loss is the crucial element of the analogy, and only Story B captures that.\n"

    "order_1": "Story A is a better analogy to Story 1.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Similar Causal Chain:** In Story 1, Mark's chickens attack him, *causing* him to leave the henhouse, which *allows* a thief to steal the eggs.  In Story A, Linda's scouts pester her, *causing* her to flee, which *allows* the tidal wave to damage the camp.  The events are linked in a similar cause-and-effect manner.\n\n* **Unrelated Secondary Event:**  In both Story 1 and Story A, the secondary event (the theft and the tidal wave, respectively) is completely unrelated to the initial conflict (chickens attacking, scouts pestering).  This is a key similarity.\n\nStory B, on the other hand, changes the causal relationship. The tidal wave happens *before* the scouts return and attack Linda. The attack is a direct consequence of the tidal wave, not a consequence of Linda's actions or inaction.  The sequence of events, and thus the causal relationship, is different from Story 1.  The scouts' pestering is a reaction to the tidal wave, not the cause of the loss of sleeping bags, making it a less analogous story.\n",
    "order_2": "Story A is a better analogy to Story 1.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Causality:** In Story 1, the chickens' attack is an *irrelevant* event preceding the actual problem (the theft).  The chickens attacking Mark doesn't cause the eggs to be stolen; it simply creates a distraction.  In Story A, the girl scouts' attack is similarly irrelevant to the actual problem (the tidal wave).  Their complaining doesn't cause the sleeping bags to be washed away; it's a distraction during which the damage occurs.\n\n* **Structure:** Both Story 1 and Story A share a similar structure:\n\n    1.  Main character is dealing with a problem (eggs, sleeping bags).\n    2.  A seemingly unrelated event occurs (attack by animals/children) which distracts the main character.\n    3.  While the main character is distracted, a larger problem occurs (theft, tidal wave).\n\nStory B, however, reverses the order of events. The main problem (the tidal wave) happens *after* the distraction, making it less analogous to Story 1.  The distraction in Story B is not a separate event creating an opportunity for disaster; it\u2019s simply a minor annoyance preceding the major event.  The causal relationship is different.\n"

    "order_1": "Story A is a better analogy to Story 1.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Similar Resolution:** Both Story 1 and Story A end with a third party (Sheriff Jones/Mrs. Lee) resolving the conflict by fairly dividing the contested resource.  This division leads to a positive outcome \u2013 friendship and cooperation in Story 1, and an equitable sharing of the money in Story A.  The core similarity is the intervention leading to a mutually beneficial outcome that the initial disputants could have achieved themselves.\n\n* **Story B's Different Outcome:** Story B lacks this crucial parallel.  The third party (Lee) doesn't resolve the conflict fairly; she takes the money for herself. This results in a negative outcome, unlike Story 1 where the intervention leads to a positive resolution.  The key element of a fair division and subsequent cooperation is missing in Story B.\n\nTherefore, the structure and resolution of Story A mirror Story 1 much more closely than Story B does.  The underlying theme of a potentially avoidable conflict resolved by a third party, resulting in a positive outcome for all involved is the shared characteristic.\n",
    "order_2": "Story B is a better analogy to Story 1.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Similar Resolution:** In both Story 1 and Story B, a third party intervenes, but ultimately leads to a fair and positive resolution.  Sheriff Jones divides the land, and Mrs. Lee divides the money.  In both cases, the initial conflict is resolved peacefully, leading to cooperation and friendship (Story 1) or at least a fair outcome (Story B).\n\n* **Dissimilar Resolution in Story A:** In Story A, the third party, Lee, takes the money for herself. This changes the outcome significantly and doesn't parallel the resolution of Story 1 where the dispute leads to a mutually beneficial outcome for Smith and Johnson.  The intervention in Story A doesn't result in a fair division or reconciliation, unlike the interventions in Story 1 and Story B.\n\n\nTherefore, Story B mirrors the structure and resolution of Story 1 more closely than Story A does.  The key similarity lies in the third party's role facilitating a fair division and indirectly teaching a lesson about cooperation.\n"

    "order_1": "Story A is a better analogy to Story 1.\n\nBoth stories involve a protagonist acting out of anger and revenge after a perceived injustice related to a superior's actions (salary increase for the principal/vacation for the captain, while the subordinate is denied similar benefits).  The revenge actions are also similar in their destructive nature (arson vs. explosion).\n\nStory B reverses the cause-and-effect. The captain's vacation announcement is *after* McGhee's act of revenge, breaking the parallel of the principal's action preceding Mrs. Jackson's revenge in Story 1.  Story B describes an impulsive act without the clear motivation of revenge stemming from a specific prior action by the superior.\n",

Mrs. Jackson's anger and subsequent arson are directly caused by the principal's salary increase and refusal to increase teacher salaries. Similarly, McGhee's act in Story B is directly caused by the captain's announcement that he gets vacation while the crew doesn't.\n\n* **Temporal Order:** The events in Story 1 and Story B unfold in the same order:  injustice -> anger -> revenge.

    "order_2": "Story A is a better analogy to Story 1.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Causality:** In Story 1, the cobra's defensive strike *initiates* the chain of events leading to both animals' deaths.  The falcon's response is a direct consequence of the cobra's attack.  In Story A, Gene's act of hitting the policeman is the initiating event, leading to the policeman's incapacitation and their subsequent deaths.  The policeman's reaction is a direct consequence.\n\n* **Symmetry of Action/Reaction:**  Story 1 shows a relatively symmetrical action-reaction sequence:  attack (cobra), retaliatory action (falcon), accidental consequence (death of both). Story A mirrors this symmetry: attack (Gene), retaliatory action (policeman), accidental consequence (death of both).\n\nStory B breaks this symmetry.  While Gene's initial aggression is similar, the policeman's subsequent kidnapping is not a direct, immediate reaction to the blow.  The sequence is more sequential and less causally intertwined than the action-reaction pattern in Story 1 and Story A.  The policeman's decision to take Gene away is an independent decision, rather than a direct response to being hit.  This makes it a less analogous scenario.\n"
