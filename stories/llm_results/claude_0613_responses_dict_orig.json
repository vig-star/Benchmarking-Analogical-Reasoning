    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the person fails to achieve the goal needed to receive the desired reward because they spend their time dreaming about the reward rather than working towards the goal. Story A differs in that the reason Karen fails is that she was already too far behind, not because of dreaming about the reward.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the person fails to achieve the goal (passing inspection/graduating) needed to obtain the incentive (gingerbread/Hawaii trip) because they spent too much time daydreaming and were too far behind, not because they ran out of time. Story A differs in that Karen failed because she dreamed about the incentive rather than catching up on schoolwork. In less than 50 words, Story B matches more closely."

  "Task 2": {
    "order_1": " Story A is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, an accident occurs which prompts the manager to implement a safety feature that was previously recommended but initially dismissed. Story B differs in that the safety feature was initially dismissed even after being recommended, whereas in Story 1 it was recommended only after the accident occurred.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the accident occurs first, then the safety recommendation is made and implemented. Story A differs in that the safety recommendation occurs before the accident. Only Story B matches the sequence of events in Story 1."

  "Task 3": {
    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist hires/marries a second person to avoid the same problem happening again, but this backfires and leads to an even worse outcome. Story A does not have this key plot element of the attempted solution making the situation worse, so it is not as analogous.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the main character boasts about never having a problem thanks to a redundancy they put in place. When that fails, they implement an expensive second redundancy. Story A does not have this same plot structure and solution."
  },
  "Task 4": {
    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist tries to appease an aggressive enemy by offering something valuable, but the enemy ultimately uses what was given to attack the protagonist. Story A differs because Gagrach keeps its promise not to attack Zerdia after receiving the computers.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the aggressor (the hunter, Gagrach) attacks the protagonist (the hawk, Zerdia) and fails. The protagonist then offers something the aggressor wants (feathers, computers) in exchange for a promise not to attack again. Story A does not fit this pattern as well since Zerdia is attacked successfully after supplying the computers."
  },
  "Task 5": {
    "order_1": " Story A is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist undertakes a risky action without fully understanding the dangers, suffers severe consequences, and ultimately retreats from the endeavor. Story B involves acting against expert advice, rather than acting without sufficient understanding. In 50 words or less, Story A best parallels the sequence of acting overconfidently, facing harsh results, and reversing course.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. Both stories involve a protagonist who underestimates the risks of an activity, pursues it excessively, suffers severe consequences, and ultimately retreats from the activity. Story A lacks the excessive risk-taking and severe consequences of Stories 1 and B. In less than 50 words, Story B more closely parallels the narrative arc and themes of Story 1."
  },
  "Task 6": {
    "order_1": " Story A is a better analogy to Story 1. Both involve a character who wants an item they believe to be of poor quality in order to test their hypothesis, but they are unable to obtain the item due to circumstances beyond their control, leading to disappointment. Story B involves the character rationalizing not purchasing an unaffordable item by concluding it was uninteresting anyway.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. Both Story 1 and Story B involve a character (Julius the mule and Cindy) noticing something (pears and records) that looks unappealing, considering getting those things to test if their negative prediction is correct, but ultimately being unable to obtain the items due to an obstacle (the pears being too high and the records being too expensive). This results in disappointment. Story A does not closely parallel this narrative structure and details."
  },
  "Task 7": {
    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the main character expects a reward for an offering, but the recipient is disappointed with the main character's actions and denies the expected reward. Story A differs in that the disappointment is with the specific offering rather than the overall behavior of the main character.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, a character expects to receive something of value after giving a gift, but the gift is not appreciated and the request is denied. Story A differs in that there is no mention of an unsatisfactory gift being given before the request for money. Story B more closely parallels Story 1's plot points and flow."
  },
  "Task 8": {
    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1 because in both stories the protagonist drops/breaks his own item (steak or watch) before trying to take someone else's, whereas in Story A Charlie drops his watch before seeing the other watch. Story B matches the sequence of events more closely.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist (Leonard/Charlie) loses an item (steak/watch) by accident. Then they try to take a similar item from someone else to replace it, but face negative consequences (losing a tooth/the other person being a policeman) as a result. Story A does not have the initial accidental loss of an item that Stories 1 and B share."
  },
  "Task 9": {
    "order_1": " Story A is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, one partner makes a mistake (Ivan loses money, Christine dents the car) which causes the other partner to limit their involvement (Boris limits Ivan's money involvement, John bans Christine from driving his car). Story B has an additional element of intentional harm that is not present in Story 1.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, one partner makes a mistake that costs the other money, leading the other to restrict their access. Story A involves intentional harm, which is not analogous. Story B more closely matches the situation and emotional dynamics of Story 1."
  },
  "Task 10": {
    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, one smaller entity (Moreland/Bolon) tries to make a deal with a larger threat (Chad/Mayonia) by betraying the other smaller entity (Lincoln/Salam). But their plan backfires and the larger threat overpowers them both. Story A lacks this key element of one smaller entity betraying the other, so Story B better parallels Story 1.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, one small country/kid (Moreland) tries to take advantage of the situation by overpowering the other small country/kid (Salam/Lincoln). This leaves them vulnerable when the bigger threat (Mayonia/Chad) arrives and takes advantage of the weakness caused by the initial act of aggression. Story A has a different sequence of events."

  "Task 11": {
    "order_1": " Story A is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, a valued thing (the apricot tree, the canary) becomes ill. Someone who appreciates that thing decides to care for it themselves by paying the owner and moving it to their own place. Upon being moved, the valued thing flourishes again. Story B differs in the critical aspect that the valued thing does not flourish again when moved.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the valued object (the apricot tree and the canary) becomes ill while in the original owner's care. After being moved to the new owner's care, the valued object recovers and produces its prized output again (delicious apricots and beautiful songs). Story A differs in that the canary becomes ill only after being moved, so it is not an analogous situation. Story B matches the situation more closely."
  },
  "Task 12": {
    "order_1": " Story A is a better analogy to Story 1. Both involve a character who follows the advice of another character, leading them to get caught when they try to sneak away. Story B does not involve the character listening to and following someone else's advice, so it is less analogous.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the main character listens to and follows advice from another person, which leads to them getting caught. Story A does not have this key plot similarity of the main character following someone else's advice to their detriment."

  "Task 13": {
    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the wife/chamberlain complains that the man is not spending enough time/money on maintaining his house/kingdom's infrastructure. The man ignores this advice leading to an accident that injures him and shows him that the complaint was valid. Story A differs in the key detail that the complaint was that he was not spending enough time on his job rather than on infrastructure.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist is obsessed with their main interest (conquests for King Otto, astronomy for Cornelius), this causes domestic issues (bridges, house), their spouse complains, they ignore this and focus more on their interest, then get injured, and realize they need more balance. Story A lacks the key element of the spouse complaining about too much focus on the main interest."
  },
  "Task 14": {
    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist falls asleep and wakes to find something missing, then yells/shouts, attracting the \"threat\", wishes they had left it alone, gives something up to escape, and retreats to safety. Story A differs in the order of events.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist tries to scare away an intruder by yelling, which backfires. They then throw something at the intruder to distract them, and lose an additional item after thinking they are safe. Story A does not have these key plot similarities of an initial failed attempt to scare away the intruder followed by a subsequent loss."
  },
  "Task 15": {
    "order_1": " Story A is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the attack happens when the group returns and finds the person responsible for them. In Story B, the attack happens after the sleeping bags are already washed away, so there is no direct provocation like in Story 1 and Story A.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the director/farmer is pestered by their charges (chickens/girl scouts) while trying to figure things out, causing them to yell at the chickens/scouts and flee. The tidal wave/thief plotlines are irrelevant to the analogy between the stories."
  },
  "Task 16": {
    "order_1": " Story A is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, a third party (Sheriff Jones, Mrs. Lee) intervenes and divides the disputed item (land, money) evenly between the two arguing parties (Smith & Johnson, Betty & Norma). This leads to a peaceful resolution. Story B lacks the key element of third party intervention and peaceful resolution, so is not as analogous.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, a third party (Sheriff Jones, Mrs. Lee) intervenes and divides the disputed item (land, money) evenly between the two arguing parties.

  },
  "Task 17": {
    "order_1": " Story A is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist reacts to an unfair decision by the authority figure by damaging their property, then engaging in additional bad behavior. Story B has the events in the reverse order, weakening the analogy.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the protagonist hears an unfair announcement, becomes angry, and takes extreme revenge. Story A differs in that McGhee tries to blow up the cabin before the captain makes his announcement.

  "Task 18": {
    "order_1": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, the initial aggressor (the falcon/policeman) grabs the other (the cobra/Gene) and takes them away against their will. Then, the one who was grabbed (the cobra/Gene) fights back in a panic, leading to an unfortunate ending for both. Story A has the order of events reversed, with Gene initially aggressing against the policeman unprovoked.",
    "order_2": " Story B is a better analogy to Story 1. In both stories, one character attacks the other out of fear/panic, then the attacked character retaliates by forcibly taking the attacker away.
